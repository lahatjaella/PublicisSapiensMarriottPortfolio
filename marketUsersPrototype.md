## Step 2: Understand Your Users

### Themes Emerging from User Research

The user research suggests that while the Homes and Villas website offers some useful features, it lacks key functionalities found on comparable sites like Airbnb and Vrbo. A significant connection between qualitative feedback and quantitative survey results reveals that many users are seeking inspiration and guidance, with 38.67% knowing what type of vacation they want but not having settled on a destination, and 27.44% looking for inspiration entirely. Users express frustration with the overwhelming map and the absence of an inspiration hub to guide their travel planning. They desire more intuitive navigation and the ability to explore destinations by type (e.g., beach, mountain) rather than specific locations. Users also wish for rich, upfront information about destinations and activities. Overall, they seek a more engaging and informative booking experience, akin to the inspiration-focused approach seen on other platforms. This indicates a need for Homes and Villas by Marriott Bonvoy to incorporate features that inspire and simplify the decision-making process for undecided travelers.
